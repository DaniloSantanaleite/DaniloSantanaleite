## Hello! I'm Danilo Leite👋🏼

I graduated in International Trade from the University of São Paulo City and have a passion for studying languages, with good knowledge of English. My skills include problem-solving, communication, analytical thinking, and interpersonal relationships.

Also, I have a strong interest in technology and a genuine curiosity about the field of Web Development. Currently, I am deeply engaged in learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
